# Essential Services

Essential services are the bare minimum services needed to support all other GitOps within the system. Essential services are broken up across several phases:

- **Collector** - This machine is internet connected and responsible for collecting (once) all of the required packages for building the essential services offline.

- **Host** - This is the machine responsible for hosting the essential services. This is were we'll need to ensure there is an OS that meets a number of configuration assumptions. This host does not need to be internet connected to build and/or host the essential services.

- **Services** - These are the descriptors for the essential services. Note: By design, none of the essential services are managed by GitOps.

  - Critical Package Service - HTTP server hosting relevant packages.
  - DNSMasq - DNS Server
  - Caddy - CA & HTTPS Server
  - Gitea - Git Server

## Install

1. Login to the host
2. Install `git`
3. `git clone `
4. Install docker with `host/install-docker.sh`




## Notes

Reasonable defaults for Debian 12 install. No Desktop Environment. Included SSH server and standard system utilities.

- Install sudo and git

```
su
apt-get update
apt-get install -y sudo git
/sbin/adduser cicd sudo
```

- Set SSH to port 2222

```
su
echo "Port 2222" > /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/port2222.conf
systemctl restart sshd
```

- Collect critical packages

```
mkdir -p /opt/{managedcfg,state,imports}
chown cicd /opt/{managedcfg,state,imports}
cd /opt/managedcfg
git clone https://github.com/crazychenz/lab_essential.git essential
cd essential/collector
sudo ./install-docker.sh
sudo ./collect-critical_pkgs.sh
```

```
cd host
sudo ./build.sh
```

```
cd services
docker compose up -d critical_pkgs_svc
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```
